Datasets in CSV files contain medical and demographic data for individuals across 4 cities in the United States that either were or were not diagnosed with heart disease. 

These datasets were first cleansed and normalized using Python Pandas.

Then, with the intent of building an accurate classification algorithm to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on their medical and demographic data, different models were trained. Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Algorithm, and Random Forest were all used.
